There are two kinds of code. One is wriiten in c++ and the other is written in sage.

1. The c++ code can only be used to test the 2-round attack on smalle-sate Rasta and it is much efficient than the sage code.

2. The sage code can be used to test the 3-round attack and we can benefit from its simplicity.
